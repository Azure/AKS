## Background

As more intelligent applications are deployed and hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), network and disk I/O performance become more critical for the overall user experience. For example, an AI web server operating in an AKS cluster need handle high volumes of network traffic with low latency, while retrieving contextual data â€” such as conversation history and user feedback from a database and interacting with a large language model through prompt requests and streamed inference responses.

In this blog post, we share how we conducted simple benchmark tests to identify the best price-performance trade-offs in terms of network and disk I/O. We also provide recommendations on key kernel settings to maximize network performance across different VM SKU options.
