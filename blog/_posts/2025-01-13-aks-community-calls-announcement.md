As we start 2025, we are thrilled to announce a new initiative from the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Product Group: The **AKS Community Calls**. These monthly sessions are designed to foster a closer connection with our community, providing a platform to discuss the product roadmap and address your questions directly

## So what should you expect from the AKS Community Calls?

The AKS Community Calls are a fantastic opportunity for users to stay informed about the latest developments and upcoming features in AKS. Each session will include a review of the AKS public feature roadmap, which outlines features currently in development, available for public preview, and generally available. This roadmap will be a key focus of our discussions, offering valuable insights into what’s coming next for AKS.
You will also have opportunity to post your questions that will be answered directly by the AKS product team during the call.


## When and Where

These calls will be held every third Wednesday of the month at 8 AM PST (4 PM GMT). Our first session is scheduled for January 15th at 8 AM PST / 4 PM GMT. This invite is open to everyone, and we encourage all AKS users and enthusiasts to join us
