In London at KubeCon EU 2025, AKS shared our exciting announcement regarding our expansion of what AKS Long Term Support (LTS) includes. Today, we're thrilled to share more details about this game-changing offering that addresses one of the most critical challenges enterprises face when running Kubernetes at scale.

From our conversations with customers, we consistently hear the same concerns: *"How do I balance Kubernetes innovation with the stability my business-critical applications require?"* and *"Why do I need to upgrade my clusters so frequently when my applications are running perfectly?"* AKS LTS directly solves these real-world challenges.

## Why AKS LTS Matters

Enterprise organizations running mission-critical workloads on Kubernetes have consistently told us they need more predictable, stable platform foundations. While the rapid innovation pace of Kubernetes is fantastic for driving new capabilities, it can create challenges for organizations that require:

- **Extended support lifecycles** that align with enterprise planning cycles
- **Predictable upgrade windows** that minimize operational disruption
- **Stability guarantees** for production workloads that can't tolerate frequent changes
- **Compliance requirements** that demand long-term support commitments

AKS LTS directly addresses these needs by providing a **support plan** specifically designed for enterprise stability requirements.

## What is AKS LTS?

AKS Long Term Support is a **support plan** that provides **24 months** of support for Kubernetes versions from their GA date in AKS, compared to the standard 12-15 month support lifecycle. **Here's the game-changer: Every currently supported AKS Kubernetes version is now also available for long term support (LTS).** This isn't just extended maintenanceâ€”it's a comprehensive support commitment designed for enterprises running mission-critical workloads.

**The Real Impact:** Instead of planning cluster upgrades every 12-15 months, you can now plan major Kubernetes upgrades every 24 months. This **reduces upgrade frequency by 50%** and can **save enterprises 40+ hours of operational overhead annually** per cluster while maintaining full security and support coverage.

Key characteristics of AKS LTS include:

- **Extended Support Timeline:** 24 months of full support from GA date, including security patches and critical bug fixes
- **Predictable Release Cadence:** New LTS versions released annually, allowing for planned upgrade cycles
- **Enterprise-Grade Stability:** Focus on proven, stable features rather than frequent changes
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Strong commitment to API stability and workload compatibility within LTS versions
- **Integrated Azure Services:** Full compatibility with existing Azure services and AKS ecosystem features

## Enterprise Benefits at a Glance

**Reduced Operational Overhead**
- Fewer required upgrades mean less time spent on cluster maintenance
- Predictable planning cycles aligned with enterprise budgeting and resource allocation
- Reduced testing and validation overhead for workload compatibility

**Enhanced Stability**
- Production-tested Kubernetes versions with proven track record
- Minimized risk of introducing breaking changes or regressions
- Focus on reliability over cutting-edge features

**Compliance and Governance**
- Extended support timelines that meet enterprise compliance requirements
- Clear end-of-life planning with advance notice for migration planning
- Integration with Azure Policy and governance frameworks

## Technical Implementation

**Universal LTS Coverage:** AKS LTS extends to every currently supported Kubernetes version in AKS. Each version undergoes extensive testing across diverse workload patterns and enterprise scenarios to ensure LTS-grade stability and compatibility.

**Beyond Community Support:** When the Kubernetes community support ends (typically 12-14 months after a version's GA), AKS LTS continues providing comprehensive support for 24 months from the original GA date. **Crucially, once the community stops supplying patches after the official version support end-of-life, AKS continues to provide patches and CVE fixes** for all supported components. This extended support is comprehensive and includes:

- **Core Kubernetes components:** API server, etcd, kubelet, kube-proxy, and all core Kubernetes functionality
- **AKS-managed add-ons:** (see [**AKS integrations**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/integrations) for the complete list), **including networking, monitoring, and security components**, with the exception of Istio which is coming soon as mentioned in the Looking Ahead section. For the current list of unsupported add-ons and features, please refer to our [**LTS unsupported add-ons documentation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/long-term-support#unsupported-add-ons-and-features)
- **Node and OS components:** Operating system patches, security updates, and node-level components for both Linux and Windows nodes

This holistic approach ensures that every layer of your full Kubernetes stack remains supported, secure, and stable throughout the entire LTS lifecycle.

**Support Timeline Example:**
- AKS LTS 1.28 (GA: August 2024): Supported until August 2026
- AKS LTS 1.29 (GA: December 2024): Supported until December 2026
- AKS LTS 1.30 (GA: May 2025): Supported until May 2027
- Future LTS versions will follow the same 24-month support commitment from their respective GA dates

For the most up-to-date information on LTS version support timelines, please refer to the [AKS LTS calendar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/supported-kubernetes-versions?tabs=azure-cli#lts-versions).


Throughout the support lifecycle, AKS LTS versions receive:
- Security patches and vulnerability fixes
- Fixes for critical bugs that impact stability or functionality
- Azure service integration updates
- Compatibility updates for ecosystem tools and applications

**Stay Informed:** You can track LTS patch rollouts and new LTS version availability in real-time using the [AKS Release Tracker](https://releases.aks.azure.com/webpage/index.html) under the Kubernetes version tab. This provides complete visibility into your LTS support lifecycle and upcoming releases.

## Getting Started with AKS LTS

Creating an AKS cluster with LTS support is straightforward and uses the same familiar tools and processes you already know. Here's a simple example using Azure CLI:

```bash
# Create an AKS cluster with LTS support
az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSLTSCluster \
    --tier LTS \
    --kubernetes-version 1.29 \
    --node-count 3
```

You can also deploy AKS clusters with LTS support using:
- **Azure Portal:** Select "Long Term Support" option during cluster creation
- **ARM Templates/Bicep:** Specify the LTS tier in your infrastructure-as-code deployments
- **Terraform:** Updated AKS provider supports LTS cluster configuration

**Important:** AKS LTS is available as part of the **Premium tier**. For detailed pricing information, please refer to the [AKS Premium tier pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/).

AKS clusters with LTS support maintain full compatibility with the existing AKS ecosystem, including Azure Monitor, Azure Policy, and all AKS-managed add-ons.

**Industry-Leading Ecosystem Support:** Unlike other cloud providers that typically limit LTS guarantees to the base Kubernetes API, AKS LTS provides comprehensive support for popular add-ons and components that enterprises depend on for production workloads. This includes coordinated breaking change management, timely CVE fixes, and compatibility assurance throughout the LTS lifecycle.
