Networking, Observability and Upgrades are among the most common topics of discussions that we face with customers on AKS. Users have a number of options for these on AKS and they often wonder what are the best features to adopt for the same. 
Furthermore, we have seen a common patterns in majority of the support issues that customers create and the conversations that we have with customers. *So, we wanted to share some of those common mistakes that customers make and what are the right settings and features for customers to use to make running AKS in production at scale easier.*
