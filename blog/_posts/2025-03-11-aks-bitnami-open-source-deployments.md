Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a highly managed platform that simplifies deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes on Azure. When paired with Bitnami's open-source solutions available on Azure Marketplace, AKS becomes an even more powerful platform for accelerating the deployment of Kubernetes workloads that rely on popular open-source projects.

Bitnami, a leader in open-source packaging and security for nearly 15 years, offers a catalog of over 250 pre-packaged open-source Kubernetes applications. These solutions are maintained with continuous updatesâ€”over 1,000 releases monthlyâ€”ensuring users always have access to the latest upstream patches and security fixes.

With Bitnamiâ€™s ready-to-use Kubernetes apps, available directly in the Azure Marketplace, users can skip writing Helm charts, YAML files, or custom deployment scripts. Instead, they can follow simple guides to deploy production-ready open-source software in just a few clicks.

This seamless integration allows teams to focus on building and innovating rather than managing infrastructure. Additionally, the automatic and timely security updates from Bitnami simplify lifecycle management and enhance the security posture of Kubernetes workloads on Azure.


### Why AKS + Bitnami OSS?

âœ” Instant Open-Source Deployments on AKS

Bitnami's Kubernetes-optimized OSS solutions let you deploy databases, web apps, developer tools, and more on AKS quickly.

- **Deploy faster** â€“ Get up and running in minutes with pre-configured applications. Deploy one-click via Azure marketplace onto your AKS cluster.
- **Reduce operational overhead** â€“ Let AKS manage infrastructure while Bitnami provides security-hardened OSS solutions.
- **Ensure enterprise-grade reliability** â€“ Built-in Azure scaling and monitoring keep applications running smoothly.
- **Simplified Kubernetes Management**: AKS is a fully managed Kubernetes platform that handles infrastructure complexities, freeing your team from operational burdens like cluster upgrades and patching. The Bitnami packaged OSS apps manage the application lifecycle, further reducing your workload.
- **Enhanced Security and Reliability**: Bitnami's open-source Kubernetes apps on Azure Marketplace are pre-packaged, secure, and rigorously certified. Each app undergoes thorough vulnerability scans and regular updates to ensure security and reliability.
- **Innovate with open source**: By using Bitnami's open-source strengths, you gain flexibility, transparency, and community-driven innovation. This helps your team build confidently on proven technology stacks, using popular open-source projects in your AKS workloads.

### Better Together: AKS + Bitnami OSS for Cloud-Native Success

By combining the power of AKS with Bitnami's trusted open-source applications, organizations can:

- **âœ” Strengthen security posture** â€“ Bitnami apps are pre-hardened, regularly updated, and scanned for vulnerabilities, while AKS provides built-in features like RBAC, network policies, and automated patching to safeguard your workloads.
- **âœ” Deploy faster** â€“ Get up and running in minutes with pre-configured applications. Deploy one-click via Azure marketplace onto your AKS cluster or programmatically via Terraform, Azure CLI or ARM templates.
- **âœ” Ensure enterprise-grade reliability** â€“ Built-in Azure scaling and monitoring keep applications running smoothly.
